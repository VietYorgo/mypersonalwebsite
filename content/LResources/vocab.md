# How to Truly Learn Vocabulary in a Foreign Language

Do you remember learning thousands of words as a child using flashcards and
language apps like Duolingo? Of course not—this isn’t how you learned your
native language. You acquired it by listening and reading
**a lot** of material.

Despite this, many people try to learn foreign languages by memorizing word
lists with flashcards or apps. It’s no wonder this method often leads to
frustration and self-doubt.

In this article, I’ll assume that vocabulary acquisition in a foreign language
works fundamentally the same way as in your native language. Let’s explore
what this means for your learning approach.

## 1. Stay Patient—Especially If You’re a Beginner

If you’ve ever been around a baby, think about how long it takes them to learn
even the basics of their native language. While adults have an
advantage—experience, reasoning skills, and prior knowledge—it
_still_ takes time to grasp the basics of a new language.

The beginner stage (up to A2) is often the hardest. At this level, you’re
unfamiliar with the sounds, structure, and appearance of the language.
Progress feels slow, but this stage is foundational for everything that
follows. Be patient!

## 2. Unconscious Learning Comes First

Think back to how you learned your native language. You now know an estimated
15,000–20,000 words (according to the BBC), and you did this
_without_ memorizing word lists. Instead, you absorbed massive amounts
of material.

To reach even A1 (about 700 words), consider how much effort flashcards would
require. While flashcards might help in moderation, they don’t immerse you in
the language.

Knowing words isn’t enough. To say something as simple as
**“I want to buy bread,”** you also need to understand word
order, verb conjugations, prepositions, and more. Language is more than
vocabulary—context and structure matter.

## 3. Quantity Is Key

If unconscious learning is your primary method, it’s clear that
**quantity** matters. Vocabulary acquisition through exposure
takes time.

You’ll need to encounter the same words repeatedly and in different contexts
before they stick. Re-reading familiar material can also reinforce what you’ve
already learned.

## 4. Learn to Guess

Guessing is an essential skill when learning a language. Instead of fixating
on words you don’t know, focus on what you
_do_ understand. Use context to piece together meaning.

This is why exposure to rich, meaningful content—like stories, movies, or
comics—is so valuable. These materials provide hints through visuals, tone,
and narrative structure.

## 5. Embrace Context

Context helps you guess and remember words more effectively. Think of how
actors’ expressions in a movie or images in a comic book clarify meaning.

As a child, I loved comics, much to my parents’ dismay. But comics offered an
excellent mix of visuals and text, making vocabulary acquisition easier. The
same principle applies to language learners.

Whenever possible, learn words as part of a story or a meaningful situation.
Isolated memorization (e.g., flashcards) is far less effective.

## 6. Use Deliberate Effort for Some Cases

Certain phrases—like collocations (_“call it a day”_ or
_“a call for action”_)—are hard to guess, even for advanced learners.
In these cases, deliberate effort, such as looking up meanings or practicing
specific phrases, can be helpful.

## Final Thoughts

Language learning is about patience, immersion, and meaningful practice. While
flashcards and apps have their place, they shouldn’t replace the most
effective tools: consistent exposure to the language and engaging with rich
content.
