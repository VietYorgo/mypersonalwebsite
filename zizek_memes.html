        In a traditional German toilet, the hole where waste disappears after flushing is located at the front, allowing us to inspect and sniff the excrement for signs of illness. In contrast, the typical French toilet places the hole at the back, encouraging waste to disappear as quickly as possible. The American (or Anglo-Saxon) toilet strikes a balance between these two extremes: the basin is filled with water, so the waste floats, visible but not meant for inspection.
  

   
        Itâ€™s clear that these designs cannot be explained solely by utilitarian reasons. Each reflects an underlying ideological view of how we should relate to excrement. The German approach suggests reflective thoroughness, the French prioritize revolutionary hastiness, while the American design embraces pragmatic disposal.
  
        Philosopher Hegel noted that Germany, France, and England represent three distinct existential attitudes: German thoroughness, French radicalism, and English pragmatism. Politically, these attitudes manifest as German conservatism, French revolutionary radicalism, and English liberalism. Toilets offer us a unique lense to observe these ideologies in action, showing how different cultures relate to "excremental excess": a fascination with it, a desire to get rid of it quickly, or treating it pragmatically as ordinary waste.
    
        While some may argue we live in a post-ideological age, a visit to the toilet reveals just how deeply ideology permeates even the most intimate aspects of life. (Actual quote)
