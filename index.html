<h1>Work experience</h1>

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgios-michalopoulos-82bb4396/">My LinkedIn profile</a>  (has not been updated for some time).<br> <br>
I have taught Spanish, French, and English in a variety of "frontistiria" (Greek cram schools) in Athens, the Piraeus, and Drapetsona. <br> <br>
I have also taught Greek as a foreign language to the employees of Teleperformance in Greece. 
<br> <br>
 I have taught private classes for many years, since my early 20s, both online and in person. 
<br> <br> 
Finally, I taught for a year various courses of Modern Greek and European History at Panteion University, in Athens.
