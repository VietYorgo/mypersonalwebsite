## About Me

I am a foreign language teacher and learner. [Join my Philosophy Discord Server](https://discord.gg/xDj2WM75Vd).

## What I'm Working On

I'm currently obsessed with learning Vietnamese, and I split my time between Athens, Greece, and Báº¯c Ninh, Vietnam.

## Languages I Speak

Native speaker.

Near native. I studied in the UK with a scholarship from the Greek State. I hold a PhD in European History [from Oxford](https://i.imgur.com/XS0Q1mb.jpeg) and an MPhil [from Cambridge](https://i.imgur.com/WBvVSs6.jpeg).

## Work Experience

Starting in my early 20s, I have taught Greek, French, English, and Spanish to groups and individual students. Since 2015, I have been teaching online as well.

I also taught courses on Modern Greek and European Diplomatic History at Panteion University in Athens.
