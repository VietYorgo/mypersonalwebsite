# What Teaching Taught Me to Do Differently in Language Learning

## 1. Context Matters

Learning words through direct word-for-word translation (e.g., using Anki) can
work in the short term—especially for cramming before an exam—but it doesn’t
create lasting memories. To make new words stick, focus on context: write and
listen to sentences that use your target words.

A practical tip: extract the words you want to learn from a text or video you
enjoy, then create exercises on a platform like Quizlet. Combine vocabulary
practice with rewatching or rereading the material to reinforce learning.

## 2. Language Learning Takes Time

Reaching a B2 level in a foreign language is a marathon, not a sprint—unless
the language is closely related to one you already know (e.g., Italian for
Spanish speakers).

Many people underestimate how long it takes because they:

- Learned a similar language quickly.
- Misremember how long it took to learn as a child.

  In reality, consistent effort over several years is needed for most languages.
  Unrealistic expectations (e.g., learning Greek to B2 in two years) often lead
  to disappointment. Be patient; progress builds over time.

## 3. YouTube Is Your Best Resource

Videos offer a combination of images and audio, which helps with both
comprehension and memory. In contrast, textbooks are often:

- Expensive.
- Overloaded with grammar from the start.
- Unrealistic for absolute beginners (A1–A2 levels).

Start with content you enjoy and let the visuals guide your understanding.

## 4. When to Study Grammar

Grammar is most useful for:

- **Getting an overview:** Learn general structures like word order, verb tenses, or grammatical genders. A quick read through a Wikipedia article on your target language can be enough for this.
- **Clarifying patterns you’ve encountered:** For example, you notice plural endings but aren’t sure which applies when. Study grammar to refine your understanding of these observed patterns.

Grammar should support your learning, not overwhelm you at the start.

## 5. Finding Time and Motivation

If time is limited, consistency is key. Even 10 minutes, five days a week, can
lead to progress over time. Build a support network:

- If you’re in the target country, find patient, encouraging speakers.
- If not, join language learner communities online or in-person.

## 6. You Don’t Need Total Focus

Contrary to popular belief, language learning doesn’t require intense
concentration. Simply listening passively—like leaving the TV on while doing
chores—can be effective. Personally, I enjoy listening to Russian radio while
working, and over time, I’ve noticed clear improvements.

## 7. Explaining Pronunciation Matters

Many learners struggle with pronunciation because they aren’t aware of their
mistakes. As a teacher, I’ve observed students unknowingly modify or add
sounds.

_The Economist_ noted in October 2021 that poor pronunciation teaching
contributes to heavy accents.

Textbooks often lack depth on rhythm, stress, and intonation. A good teacher
can make a big difference by pointing out subtle errors and helping students
refine their speech.

## 8. Not All Beginners Are the Same

Beginners vary widely in their starting points due to:

- **Similar language knowledge:** Knowing a related language (e.g., French for Italian learners) provides a significant head start.
- **Educational background:** Well-educated learners often grasp complex topics faster and have better learning strategies.
- **Experience with foreign languages:** Multilingual learners tend to have a clearer understanding of the process and their goals.

Teachers should tailor their approach to "true beginners" who lack these
advantages, setting realistic expectations and offering extra support.

## 9. Rethink School Grammar

School often emphasizes memorizing grammar rules for exams, which doesn’t
translate well to real-world use.

For example, many textbooks teach the accusative case early, despite learners
having little vocabulary or grammatical context to apply it. Understanding
when to use the accusative requires:

- Knowing which words are masculine.
- Mastering articles (definite/indefinite).
- Differentiating cases (e.g., accusative vs. genitive).

  For beginners, time is better spent on vocabulary and phrases they can
  immediately use. Grammar makes more sense as their skills grow.

## 10. Duolingo Has Limits

Duolingo is helpful for:

- Learning a new alphabet.
- Building a basic vocabulary.

Beyond that, it’s easy to spend hours translating sentences without real
progress. The app doesn’t offer meaningful immersion or natural audio. For
vocabulary, apps like Memrise or Quizlet let you customize your learning and
can be more effective.

If you have 15 minutes, check out [Stephen Krashen’s insights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiTsduRreug) on language acquisition. His ideas on natural learning and input are > invaluable.

## Final Thoughts

These reflections are based on my experience as both a learner and a teacher.
While some details may vary, the overall picture is clear: language learning
is a gradual process that requires exposure, practice, and patience—not just
memorization of rules.

If passing exams is your top priority, focus on that. But don’t mistake it for
true mastery. Real learning involves immersion, consistent effort, and a
willingness to make mistakes. Keep going, and you’ll get there!
